Python Pair Programming Week 4-6 : Text Sentiment Analysis

Python Pair Programming for Week 1-3 - Analysis on Scikit Learn California Housing Dataset

This purpose of this submission was to frame a business question, analyse text data and perform sentiment analysis

Business Context :

Apple has just launched its newest flagship phone, iPhone 14, in September 2022 and is interested in measuring public's response to this product. 
Through sentiment analysis, they wish to know the following:

What is said by the public about iPhone 14?
Are there more positive reviews than negative ones?
How are new features like emergency SOS via satellite received by public?

These insights will help Apple design their next-generation iPhones.

Articles from four popular websites that reviewed iPhone 14 were extracted into text. 
Text analysis was then carried out to extract 9,121 tokens in total. 
Pre-processing steps, such as removing stopwords, punctuations, digits, and meaningless characters/words were performed to ensure that all the words analysed have a significant meaning.

The analysis results outlined more positive reviews (86%) than negative reviews (14%) for iPhone14. 
Example: From word cloud and concordance, it is observed that people appreciate the better camera and improved software processing. 
         We can also find some negative sentiments, such as the statement that the iPhone 14 is more expensive than the previous version and incremental upgrades considered challenging to notice.

The frequency distribution showed most common words present in these reviews and featured the hyped 'emergency SOS via satellite', which from concordance seems to have been appreciated by reviewers.

We would like to thank the below sources for the execution of this programming assessment, without whom this submission would not have been posssible.
